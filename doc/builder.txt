==================================
Generating Markup Programmatically
==================================

Genshi provides a ``builder`` module which lets you generate markup from Python
code using a very simple syntax. The main entry point to the ``builder`` module
is the ``tag`` object (which is actually an instance of the ``ElementFactory``
class). You should rarely (if ever) need to directly import and use any of the
other classes in the ``builder`` module.

Creating Elements
=================

Elements can be created through the `tag` object using attribute access, for
example::

  >>> from genshi.builder import tag
  >>> doc = tag.p('Some text and ', tag.a('a link', href='http://example.org/'), '.')
  >>> doc
  <Element "p">

This produces an ``Element`` instance which can be further modified to add child
nodes and attributes. This is done by “calling” the element: positional
arguments are added as child nodes (alternatively, the ``append`` method can be
used for that purpose), whereas keywords arguments are added as attributes::

  >>> doc(tag.br)
  <Element "p">
  >>> print doc
  <p>Some text and <a href="http://example.org/">a link</a>.<br/></p>

If an attribute name collides with a Python keyword, simply append an underscore
to the name::

  >>> doc(class_='intro')
  <Element "p">
  >>> print doc
  <p class="intro">Some text and <a href="http://example.org/">a link</a>.<br/></p>

As shown above, an ``Element`` can easily be directly rendered to XML text by
printing it or using the Python ``str()`` function. This is basically a
shortcut for converting the ``Element`` to a stream and serializing that
stream::

  >>> stream = doc.generate()
  >>> stream
  <genshi.core.Stream object at ...>
  >>> print stream
  <p class="intro">Some text and <a href="http://example.org/">a link</a>.<br/></p>


Creating Fragments
==================

The ``tag`` object also allows creating “fragments”, which are basically lists
of nodes (elements or text) that don't have a parent element. This can be useful
for creating snippets of markup that are attached to a parent element later (for
example in a template). Fragments are created by calling the ``tag`` object::

  >>> fragment = tag('Hello, ', tag.em('world'), '!')
  >>> fragment
  <Fragment>
  >>> print fragment
  Hello, <em>world</em>!
